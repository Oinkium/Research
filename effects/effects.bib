abstract="Models for free graded monads over the category of sets are constructed. Certain rings of generalized noncommutative polynomials, generated by an operation of arbitrary arity, are implemented as subrings of classical rings of noncommutative polynomials. It is shown that natural homomorphisms from rings of generalized polynomials to rings of the usual commutative polynomials are not inclusions as a rule. For instance, the natural homomorphism {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb{\{}F{\}}{\_}{\{}1^2 {\}} [t] {\backslash}to {\backslash}mathbb{\{}Z{\}}[A,B], t {\backslash}mapsto (A,B){\$}{\$}, where t is a binary variable, is not an inclusion even if t is subject to the alternating condition.

pages="69--86",
abstract="Monads can be used to model term rewriting systems by generalising the well-known equivalence between universal algebra and monads on the category Set. In [L{\"u}96], this semantics was used to give a purely categorical proof of the modularity of confluence for the disjoint union of term rewriting systems. This paper provides further support for monadic semantics of rewriting by giving a categorical proof of the most general theorem concerning the modularity of strong normalisation. In the process, we improve upon the technical aspects of earlier work.",
