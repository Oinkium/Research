Certain rings of generalized noncommutative polynomials, generated by an operation of arbitrary arity, are implemented as subrings of classical rings of noncommutative polynomials. It is shown that natural homomorphisms from rings of generalized polynomials to rings of the usual commutative polynomials are not inclusions as a rule. For instance, the natural homomorphism {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb{\{}F{\}}{\_}{\{}1^2 {\}} [t] {\backslash}to {\backslash}mathbb{\{}Z{\}}[A,B], t {\backslash}mapsto (A,B){\$}{\$}, where t is a binary variable, is not an inclusion even if t is subject to the alternating condition.

abstract="Monads can be used to model term rewriting systems by generalising the well-known equivalence between universal algebra and monads on the category Set. In [L{\"u}96], this semantics was used to give a purely categorical proof of the modularity of confluence for the disjoint union of term rewriting systems. This paper provides further support for monadic semantics of rewriting by giving a categorical proof of the most general theorem concerning the modularity of strong normalisation. In the process, we improve upon the technical aspects of earlier work.",

abstract = "Lawvere theories and monads have been the two main category theoretic formulations of universal algebra, Lawvere theories arising in 1963 and the connection with monads being established a few years later. Monads, although mathematically the less direct and less malleable formulation, rapidly gained precedence. A generation later, the definition of monad began to appear extensively in theoretical computer science in order to model computational effects, without reference to universal algebra. But since then, the relevance of universal algebra to computational effects has been recognised, leading to renewed prominence of the notion of Lawvere theory, now in a computational setting. This development has formed a major part of Gordon Plotkin's mature work, and we study its history here, in particular asking why Lawvere theories were eclipsed by monads in the 1960's, and how the renewed interest in them in a computer science setting might develop in future."
