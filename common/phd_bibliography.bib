 abstract = {We present a game semantics for Linear Logic, in which formulas denote games and proofs denote winning strategies. We show that our semantics yields a categorical model of Linear Logic and prove full completeness for Multiplicative Linear Logic with the MIX rule: every winning strategy is the denotation of a unique cut-free proof net. A key role is played by the notion of history-free strategy; strong connections are made between history-free strategies and the Geometry of Interaction. Our semantics incorporates a natural notion of polarity, leading to a refined treatment of the additives. We make comparisons with related work by Joyal, Blass, et al.},

abstract = "We present a game (or dialogue) semantics in the style of Lorenzen (1959) for Girard's linear logic (1987). Lorenzen suggested that the (constructive) meaning of a proposition ϕ should be specified by telling how to conduct a debate between a proponent P who asserts ϕ and an opponent O who denies ϕ. Thus propositions are interpreted as games, connectives (almost) as operations on games, and validity as existence of a winning strategy for P. (The qualifier ‘almost’ will be discussed later when more details have been presented.) We propose that the connectives of linear logic can be naturally interpreted as the operations on games introduced for entirely different purposes by Blass (1972). We show that affine logic, i.e., linear logic plus the rule of weakening, is sound for this interpretation. We also obtain a completeness theorem for the additive fragment of affine logic, but we show that completeness fails for the multiplicative fragment. On the other hand, for the multiplicative fragment, we obtain a simple characterization of game-semantical validity in terms of classical tautologies. An analysis of the failure of completeness for the multiplicative fragment leads to the conclusion that the game interpretation of the connective ⊗ is weaker than the interpretation implicit in Girard's proof rules; we discuss the differences between the two interpretations and their relative advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we discuss how Gödel's Dialectica interpretation (1958), which was connected to linear logic by de Paiva (1989), fits with game semantics. "

This model is shown to capture definability in PCF. More precisely, every compact strategy in the model is definable in a certain simple extension of PCF. We then introduce an intrinsic preorder on strategies and show that it satisfies some striking properties such that the intrinsic preorder on function types coincides with the pointwise preorder. We then obtain an order-extensional fully abstract model of PCF by quotienting the intensional model by the intrinsic preorder. This is the first syntax-independent description of the fully abstract model for PCF. (Hyland and Ong have obtained very similar results by a somewhat different route, independently and at the same time.) We then consider the effective version of our model and prove a universality theorem: every element of the effective extensional model is definable in PCF. Equivalently, every recursive strategy is definable up to observational equivalence."

C Kleene (1978, in “General Recursion Theory II, Proceedings of the 1977 Oslo Symposium,” North-Holland, Amsterdam) and R. O. Gandy (1993, “Dialogues, Blass Games, Sequentiality for Objects of Finite Type,” unpublished manuscript) in one tradition, and to G. Kahn and G. D. Plotkin (1993, Theoret. Comput. Sci.121, 187–278) and G. Berry and P.-L. Curien (1982, Theoret. Comput. Sci.20, 265–321) in another. Our model of computation is based on a kind of game in which each play consists of a dialogue of questions and answers between two players who observe the following principles of civil conversation: 1.Justification. A question is asked only if the dialogue at that point warrants it. An answer is proffered only if a question expecting it has already been asked. 2.Priority. Questions pending in a dialogue are answered on a last-asked-first-answered basis. This is equivalent to Gandy's no-dangling-question-mark condition. We analyze pcf-style computations directly in terms of partial strategies based on the information available to each player when he or she is about to move. Our players are required to play an innocent strategy: they play on the basis of their view which is that part of the history that interests them currently. Views are continually updated as the play unfolds. Hence our games are neither history-sensitive nor history-free. Rather they are view-dependent. These considerations give expression to what seems to us to be the nub of pcf-style higher-type sequentiality in a (dialogue) game-semantical setting."

Our fundamental result establishes that these representations are equivalent, by showing how to construct a unique sequential algorithm which computes a given stable and monotone function. We illustrate by defining a denotational semantics for a functional language with countable nondeterminism (“fair PCF”), with an interpretation of fixpoints which allows this to be proved to be computationally adequate. We observe that our model contains functions which cannot be computed in fair PCF, by identifying a further property of the definable elements, and so show that it is not fully abstract."

abstract="A new characterization of nondeterministic concurrent strategies exhibits strategies as certain discrete fibrations---or equivalently presheaves---over configurations of the game. This leads to a lax functor from the bicategory of strategies to the bicategory of profunctors. The lax functor expresses how composition of strategies is obtained from that of profunctors by restricting to `reachable' elements, which gives an alternative formulation of the composition of strategies. It provides a fundamental connection---and helps explain the mismatches---between two generalizations of domain theory to forms of intensional domain theories, one based on games and strategies, and the other on presheaf categories and profunctors. In particular cases, on the sub-bicategory of rigid strategies which includes `simple games' (underlying AJM and HO games), and stable spans (specializing to Berry's stable functions, in the deterministic case), the lax functor becomes a pseudo functor. More generally, the laxness of the functor suggests what structure is missing from categories and profunctors in order that they can be made to support the operations of games and strategies. By equipping categories with the structure of a `rooted' factorization system and ensuring all elements of profunctors are `reachable,' we obtain a pseudo functor embedding the bicategory of strategies in the bicategory of reachable profunctors. This shift illuminates early work on bistructures and bidomains, where the Scott order and Berry's stable order are part of a factorization system, giving a sense in which bidomains are games.",

abstract="We provide four semantics for a small programming language involving unbounded (but countable) nondeterminism. These comprise an operational one, two denotational ones based on the Egli-Milner and Smyth orders, respectively, and a weakest precondition semantics. Their equivalence is proved. We also introduce a Hoare-like proof system for total correctness and show its soundness and completeness in an appropriate sense. Admission of countable nondeterminism results in a lack of continuity of various semantic functions; moreover some of the partial orders considered are in general not cpo's and in proofs of total correctness one has to resort to the use of (countable) ordinals. Proofs will appear in the full version of the paper.",

We give an abstract reformulation of multicategories as monads in a suitable Kleisli bicategory of spans. We describe represent ability in elementary terms via universal arrows. We also give a doctrinal characterisation of representability based on a fundamental monadic adjunction between the 2-category of multicategories and that of strict monoidal categories. The first main result is the coherence theorem for representable multicategories, asserting their equivalence to strict ones, which we establish via a new technique based on the above doctrinal characterisation. The other main result is a 2-equivalence between the 2-category of representable multicategories and that of monoidal categories and strong monoidal functors. This correspondence extends smoothly to one between bicategories and a several object version of representable multicategories."

Unlike the simple λυ-calculus, the extended theories are mixtures of equivalence relations and compatible congruence relations on the term language, which significantly complicates the reasoning process. In this paper we develop fully compatible equational theories of the same imperative higher-order programming languages. The new theories subsume the original calculi of control and state and satisfy the usual Church–Rosser and Standardization Theorems. With the new calculi, equational reasoning about imperative programs becomes as simple as reasoning about functional programs."

We build a model of the pure lambda-calculus in this setting and show how to interpret a probabilistic version of the functional language PCF. We give a probabilistic interpretation of the semantics of probabilistic PCF closed terms of ground type. Last we suggest a generalization of this approach, using Banach spaces."

author = "G.D. Plotkin",
abstract = "The paper studies connections between denotational and operational semantics for a simple programming language based on LCF. It begins with the connection between the behaviour of a program and its denotation. It turns out that a program denotes ⊥ in any of several possible semantics if it does not terminate. From this it follows that if two terms have the same denotation in one of these semantics, they have the same behaviour in all contexts. The converse fails for all the semantics. If, however, the language is extended to allow certain parallel facilities behavioural equivalence does coincide with denotational equivalence in one of the semantics considered, which may therefore be called “fully abstract”. Next a connection is given which actually determines the semantics up to isomorphism from the behaviour alone. Conversely, by allowing further parallel facilities, every r.e. element of the fully abstract semantics becomes definable, thus characterising the programming language, up to interdefinability, from the set of r.e. elements of the domains of the semantics."

Groote (Eds.), Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 664, Springer, Berlin, 1993, pp. 230–244) to give mathematical content to the full abstraction problem for PCF (Milner, Theoret. Comput. Sci. 4 (1977) 1–22). We show that the ordering is in fact undecidable. This result places limits on how explicit a representation of the fully abstract model can be. It also gives a slight strengthening of the author's earlier result on typed λ-definability (Loader, in: A. Anderson, M. Zeleny (Eds.), Church Memorial Volume, Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht, to appear)."
