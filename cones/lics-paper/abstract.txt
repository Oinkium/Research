We propose a semantics for a simple stateful language with countable nondeterminism.  Our approach is based upon the game semantics for Idealized Algol given by Abramsky and McCusker, using ideas of Harmer and McCusker to extend to the nondeterministic case.  Using countable rather than finite nondeterminism leads to technical difficulties in the definition which we resolve by incorporating some infinitary information in our definition of a strategy.  We observe that countable nondeterminism presents unique challenges which can be formalized as a failure of continuity in the model, and develop novel techniques to get around these challenges.
