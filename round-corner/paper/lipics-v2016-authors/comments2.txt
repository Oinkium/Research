   == Minor points, typos, questions ==

   p1. "Melliés" -> "Melliès"

   p2. "relating their underlying structure" -> where does "their" point to?

   "This is a morphism from an initial state S into A*" -> unclear, as
   S is not the state, only its type.

   \alpha should have type A* -> F(A,A*).

   "returns a copy of f and together with [...]" -> remove "and".

   "contensts" -> "contents".

   Generally, I found Section 1.1 quite demanding, while it seems to
   be meant as a leisurly introduction. I couldn't make sense of it
   without working on paper in some detail.

   p4. The notion of determinism looks weird: are you sure you got all
   P's and O's right in this paragraph?

   Also, it would help to be a bit more formal when defining games, as
   you get back to them later on.

   Suggestion: wrap the definition of the sequoid in a proper
   definition.

   p5. Definition 3:
     - "A category Cₛ" -> "A category Cₛ."
     - Please add a reference for a right monoidal category action.

   "subcategoryof" -> "subcategory of"

   The paragraph from Definition 4 to the three isomomorphisms dec,
   dist, and dist, is (almost) duplicated. Please make your choice!

   p7. Shouldn't the state transformer have type !X -o (Σ^X x X) / !X?
   I think there are quite a few !'s missing in the following
   paragraphs.  It also seems that read should have type !X -o X / !X,
   in which case it could simply be the canonical isomorphism. Hope
   I'm not completely off the mark here :)

   p8. "with tensor powers" -> "with symmetric tensor powers".

   "id / pr_1 and id / pr_2 […] are jointly monomorphic": didn't you
   miss up the type here?

   p9. "identification of A / n" -> "identification of A^{/ n}".

   "([1],[8])" -> [1,8] (see \cite{A,B}).

   Suggestion: state more clearly at the beginning of Section 3.2 that
   its purpose is to motivate the construction of 3.3

   p11. Proof of Thm 12: can't the action of ! on morphisms be given
   directly by the anamorphism of !A -> A / !A -(f / !A)-> B / !A?  If
   so why not define it this way? Would it complicate the rest of the
   proof?

   p12. l-5: coh has a wrong type.

   l-4: "A" -> "B".

   Please explain, even informally, why the given morphism is an
   inverse to coh.
   
   Footnote: the chain of isomorphisms looks suspicious, if not buggy!

   p13. l5: "fix(f)" -> "fix_A(f)".

   Proof of Prop 16: what is dagger?

   "charactarization" -> "characterization".

   "functionsals" -> "functionals".

   p15. "final coalgebras for the functor" -> "a final coalgebra for each functor".

   "!P_A" -> "P_{!A}" (twice).

   I was expecting some condition on plays in P_{!A} saying that
   copies should be opened in order. Should it be there or not?

   p16. "idealized algol" -> "Idealized Algol".

   [5] conference/journal/booktitle is missing.

   [11]: "categorié" -> "catégories".

   [21] is severely buggy.

   [22] "ROSCOE" -> "Roscoe".
