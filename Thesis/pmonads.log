I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
here. If you just want an ampersand, the remedy is
simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.

You have given more \span or & marks than there were
in the preamble to the \halign or \valign now in progress.
So I'll assume that you meant to type \cr instead.

Missing character: There is no x in font nullfont!
Missing character: There is no . in font nullfont!
Missing character: There is no I in font nullfont!
Missing character: There is no . in font nullfont!
Missing character: There is no a in font nullfont!
! Undefined control sequence.
l.32       & x.I.a \arrow
                         [d, "m_{x,I,a}"] \\
The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

Missing character: There is no [ in font nullfont!
Missing character: There is no d in font nullfont!
Missing character: There is no , in font nullfont!
Missing character: There is no " in font nullfont!
Missing character: There is no m in font nullfont!
